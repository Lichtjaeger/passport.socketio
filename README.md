# koa-socket-passport

Koa 2 port of [passport.socketio].
Access [passport.js] user information from a [socket.io] connection in Koa 2.

> Note: Still a work in progress

## Installation
```
npm install koa-socket-passport (todo: publish to npm)
```

## Example usage
```javascript
import Koa           from 'koa' // Koa 2

import convert       from 'koa-convert'
import bodyParser    from 'koa-bodyparser'
import session       from 'koa-generic-session'
import MongoStore    from 'koa-generic-session-mongo'

import IO            from 'koa-socket'
import passport      from 'koa-passport'
import koaSocketPass from 'koa-socket-passport'

const app   = new Koa();
const io    = new IO();
const store = new MongoStore();

io.attach(app);
io.use(koaSocketPass.authorize({
  key     : 'koa.sid',
  secret  : app.keys,
  store   : store,
  success : onAuthorizeSuccess,
  fail    : onAuthorizeFail,
}));

io.on('connection', function(ctx) {
  var socket = ctx.socket;
  var user = ctx.user;
});

io.on('msg', ({ data, user, socket }) => {
  log(`${user.name} received ${data}`);
  socket.emit('ok');
});
```

## Options

### `store` [function] **required**:
One of [koa-generic-session]. Be sure to use the same store, secret, and keys as in Koa session.

### `key` [string] **optional**:
Defaults to `'koa.sid'`.

### `secret` [string] **optional**:
Defaults to `null`.

### `passport` [function] **optional**:
Defaults to `require('koa-passport')`.

### `success` [function] **optional**:
Callback which will be called everytime a *authorized* user successfuly connects to your socket.io instance.
It takes one parameter - `ksp` which contains user-information from passport, as well as koaSocketPassport related data.
You can throw an error here to reject the connection.
You can also return a promise that migh get rejected.
```javascript
function onAuthorizeSuccess(ksp) {
  var user = ksp.user;
  var session = ksp.session;
  if (user.banned) throw new Error('sorry you have been banned');
}
```


### `fail` [function] **optional**:
Callback which will be called when something goes wrong or the user couldn't be authorized.
It takes two parameter - `err)` which contains the error, and has a `err.critical` property which if `true` means something went wrong, and if `fale` it just means that user is not authorized. `ksp` contains the same info as described above. In case of critical error you can tell by how much info was gathered inside `ksp` (cookie? sid? session?) before it failed.
You can throw an error (or return a promise that might fail) here to reject the connection.
Or you can return normally and the connection won't be rejected, but there might not be a `.user` property on the socket. (which if you want you can just add another middleware to take care of)
By default, it checks if error was critical and if so it throws an error.
```javascript
function onAuthorizeFail(err, ksp){
  if (err.critical)
    throw error('Socket Authorization Failed. ', err.critical, err);
}
```

## `socket.user`
If the user was found and authorized, a `user` property will be available on socket or ctx
```
io.on('connection', function(socket){
  if(socket.user) {
    // ...
  }
})
```
In koa-socket it'll be available as `ctx.user`
```
app.io.on('msg', ctx => {
  if(ctx.user) {
    // ...
  }
});
```


## Additional methods (todo: not ported yet, don't know if they still work)

### `passportSocketIo.filterSocketsByUser`
This function gives you the ability to filter all connected sockets via a user property. Needs two parameters `function(io, function(user))`. Example:
```javascript
passportSocketIo.filterSocketsByUser(io, function(user){
  return user.gender === 'female';
}).forEach(function(socket){
  socket.emit('messsage', 'hello, woman!');
});
```

## CORS-Workaround:
If you happen to have to work with Cross-Origin-Requests (marked by socket.io v0.9 as `handshake.xdomain` and by socket.io v1.0 as `request.xdomain`) then here's a workaround:

### Clientside:
You have to provide the session-cookie. If you haven't set a name yet, do it like this: `app.use(express.session({ key: 'your.sid-key' }));`
```javascript
// Note: ther's no readCookie-function built in.
// Get your own in the internetz
socket = io.connect('//' + window.location.host, {
  query: 'session_id=' + readCookie('your.sid-key')
});
```

### Serverside:
Nope, there's nothing to do on the server side. Just be sure that the cookies names match.


## Notes:
* Does **NOT** support cookie-based sessions. eg: `express.cookieSession`
* If the connection fails, check if you are requesting from a client via CORS. Check `socket.handshake.xdomain === true` (`socket.request.xdomain === true` with socket.io v1) as there are no cookies sent. For a workaround look at the code above.
